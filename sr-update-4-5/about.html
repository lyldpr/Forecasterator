                "Forcasterator" is a web application designed to show how sea level rise in downtown Charleston will affect the prices of Air BnB locations throughout the city. Sea level rise is a widely discussed topic in Charleston, and we wanted to explore how this would affect tourism downtown. This tool visualizes the sea level rise and decrease of available properties as a way to illustrate the impact that this will have on the tourism industry. We have concluded that as sea level rise increases, there will be both less available properties, less walkability of downtown Charleston, and less availability of iconic Charleston landmarks. All of this will ultimately lead to an increase in property pricing and a decrease in overall tourism and quality of tourism. <br><br> 

                To use this application, the user simply slides the slider at the bottom of the screen to increase the year and sea level. As the sea level rise increases, Air BnB properties that are 'underwater' will be greyed out and shown as unavailable. Users can also click on individual properties to show price per night information, as well as view average price per night of all locations on the top of the screen.

                Our sea level rise simulation runs from 2022 to 2200. From our research we have found the following rate of sea level change: 
                <ul> 
                    <li>2060 - 1 ft</li>
                    <li>2090 - 2 ft</li>
                    <li>2120 - 3 ft</li>
                    <li>2140 - 4 ft</li>
                    <li>2170 - 5 ft</li>
                    <li>2190 - 6 ft</li>
                    <li>2200+ - 7 ft</li>
                    <li>2200+ - 8 ft</li>
                    <li>2200+ - 9 ft</li>
                    <li>2200+ - 10 ft</li>
                </ul> 
                Using this information as well as sea level price change data from around the country, we have concluded that as the sea level rises, there will be less available properties, causing these locations to increase an average of 7% every 10 years. This price projection does not account for inflation.
