Forecasterator Capstone Project
Jan 2022 - April 2022

A web based app that allows users to manipulate sea level rise over a map of Charleston SC, in order to determine future loss to local tourism and real estate.
The tool will use a backend of Google firebase that contains data of roughly 600+ airbnb locations. These will be displayed on a map, using the Google Maps API so that a user can see the extent of the loss of land during sea level rise. As the sea level rises many properties will be affected, consequences ranging from increased prices to being submerged underwater. The tool will hopefully at least inform users of local damage caused by climate change in our lifetimes to inspire activisim and change in the community.

from the about page:
"Forcasterator" is a web application designed to show how sea level rise in downtown Charleston will affect the prices of Air BnB locations throughout the city. Sea level rise is a widely discussed topic in Charleston, and we wanted to explore how this would affect tourism downtown. This tool visualizes the sea level rise and decrease of available properties as a way to illustrate the impact that this will have on the tourism industry. We have concluded that as sea level rise increases, there will be both less available properties, less walkability of downtown Charleston, and less availability of iconic Charleston landmarks. All of this will ultimately lead to an increase in property pricing and a decrease in overall tourism and quality of tourism.

To use this application, the user simply slides the slider at the bottom of the screen to increase the year and sea level. As the sea level rise increases, Air BnB properties that are unavailable will appear 'underwater' on the map. Users can also click on neighborhoods to show the individual properties and their price per night information, as well as view average price per night of all locations on the top of the screen.
